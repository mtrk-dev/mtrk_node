# mtrk Web UI

Web-baed UI for mtrk to provide an interface for sequence generation and testing.

**This project is still works-in-progress and not ready for use yet.**

The web UI has been developed using node.js and express.js. The libraries for handling mtrk files have been designed such that they can either be executed on the serverside (via node.js) or in the browser on the frontend side.
